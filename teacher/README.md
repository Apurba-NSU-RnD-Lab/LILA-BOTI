# Training Teacher Model

The teacher model takes as input an image containing an isolated printed character and outputs a probability distribution. In our experiments, we have used a Conv2 and a Resnet18 [model](models.py) as teacher.

## Synthetically Generated Isolated Printed Characters

The teacher model is trained on a synthetically generated printed isolated dataset. The dataset has been generated by using the [Text Recognition Data Generator](https://github.com/Belval/TextRecognitionDataGenerator) module.
A list of various Bangla fonts was fed to the package, along with a set of graphemes. For each grapheme in the
grapheme set, arbitrarily 160 isolated character images were generated using random augmentations.

A sample format of the dataset is provided in the [sample_dataset](sample_dataset) directory.

                        Number of epochs to train the model
  -l LEARNING_RATE, --learning-rate LEARNING_RATE
                        Learning rate
  -w WORKERS, --workers WORKERS
                        Number of workers to train the model
  -b BATCH_SIZE, --batch-size BATCH_SIZE
                        Batch size
  -d DATA_DIR, --data-dir DATA_DIR
                        Data directory containing {train, val, test} folders
  -s SAVE_DIR, --save-dir SAVE_DIR
                        Model save directory
  -m MODEL_NAME, --model-name MODEL_NAME
